# Task Manager - A Windows Applicaton

The above program is used as a simple Task Manager.
Create new tasks from scratch by using a title (20 chars limit), a description (200 chars limit), a priority (1-10) and a deadline date.
The aforementioned tasks can also be edited (updated) or simply viewed from the tasks viewer (redundant functionality). They can also be saved into a .csv file with the 'Save Tasks to File' button.
