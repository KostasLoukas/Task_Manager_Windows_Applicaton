# Task Manager - A Windows Applicaton

The above program is used as a simple Task Manager with a simple GUI.
Create new tasks from scratch by using a title (20 chars limit), a description (200 chars limit), a priority (1-10) and a deadline date.
The aforementioned tasks can also be edited (updated) or simply viewed from the tasks viewer (redundant functionality). They can also be saved into a .csv file with the 'Save Tasks to File' button.

The design of the program is very simplistic as the focus was given mostly to its functionality. It was created in Visual Studio 2019 using the Windows Forms framework.
The executable, as well as the csv file are stored into the Task Management\bin\Debug folder.
